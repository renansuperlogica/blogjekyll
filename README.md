# minima

*Minima is a one-size-fits-all Jekyll theme for writers*. It's Jekyll's default (and first) theme. It's what you get when you run `jekyll new`.

## Projeto

I created this project to study a new technology in a quickly course that you can find [here](https://www.udemy.com/criando-sites-estaticos-com-jekyll/)

Unfortunately the course is late with the technology but is a good start.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
